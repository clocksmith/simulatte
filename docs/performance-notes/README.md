# Performance & Optimization Notes

This directory contains dated technical documentation of performance optimizations, graphics improvements, and game mechanics enhancements made to the Simulatte project.

## Purpose
- Track technical improvements over time
- Document optimization techniques and their impact
- Provide reference for future development decisions
- Help onboarding developers understand the system architecture

## File Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`

Example: `2025-01-17-frustum-culling.md`

## Categories
Each note should include one of these categories:
- **Performance Optimization**: Changes that improve frame rate, reduce memory usage, or enhance responsiveness
- **Graphics Enhancement**: Visual improvements, rendering techniques, or shader optimizations
- **Game Mechanics**: Gameplay systems, simulation logic, or user interaction improvements
- **Bug Fix**: Critical fixes that unblocked functionality

## Document Structure
Each note should contain:
1. **Title**: Clear description of the change
2. **Date**: When the change was implemented
3. **Category**: Type of improvement
4. **Files Modified**: List of affected files
5. **Issue/Feature**: What problem was solved or feature added
6. **Solution/Implementation**: Technical details (1-3 paragraphs)
7. **Impact** (if applicable): Performance metrics, before/after comparisons
