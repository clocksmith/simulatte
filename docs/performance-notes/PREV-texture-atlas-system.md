## Feature
Built a comprehensive procedural texture generation system that creates detailed 16-bit style sprites at runtime, eliminating the need for external image assets and enabling dynamic, customizable graphics.

## Architecture
The texture atlas system generates a 1024×1024 pixel RGBA texture containing all game sprites packed into a single GPU texture. This approach:
- Minimizes GPU texture bindings (single bind for entire game)
- Enables efficient batch rendering
- Reduces memory bandwidth usage
- Allows runtime sprite customization

## Sprite Generation
The `texture-atlas.js` file (920+ lines) procedurally generates detailed pixel art for:
- **Terrain**: Grass with individual blade details, dirt with soil patterns, concrete with realistic textures
- **Buildings**: Brick paths with mortar patterns, benches, fountains, lighting fixtures
- **People**: Visitors, hipsters, dog walkers with clothing details and accessories
- **Activities**: 50+ different Williamsburg-themed activities (spikeball, tarot reading, vintage bikes, etc.)
- **Zones**: Visual representations for recreation, cultural, sports, and nature zones

Each sprite is drawn pixel-by-pixel using canvas 2D context with careful attention to:
- **SNES-quality shading**: Multiple tones of each color to create depth
- **Dithering patterns**: Classic 16-bit era techniques for color blending
- **Anti-aliasing**: Manual edge smoothing for curved shapes
- **Lighting simulation**: Consistent top-left light source across all sprites

## Technical Details
The shader system uses UV coordinates to map each vertex to its corresponding sprite in the atlas. The fragment shader samples the texture and mixes it with vertex colors, enabling:
- Dynamic tinting (for hover/select highlights)
- Season-based color variations
- Time-of-day lighting effects

## Memory Footprint
- Atlas texture: ~4MB RGBA (1024×1024×4 bytes)
- Sprite metadata: <1KB (UV coordinates and dimensions)
- Total GPU memory: ~4MB for all game graphics

This system provides the flexibility of vector graphics with the performance of pre-rendered sprites, all while maintaining the nostalgic aesthetic of classic isometric simulation games.
