# Bilinear Texture Filtering Enhancement

**Date:** Prior Session (Before 2025-01-17)
**Category:** Graphics Enhancement
**Files Modified:** `public/cbg/renderer/webgpu-renderer.js`

## Feature
Implemented high-quality texture filtering for smooth, SNES-quality graphics in the isometric renderer. This replaced the default nearest-neighbor sampling with advanced filtering techniques.

## Implementation
Modified the WebGPU sampler configuration in `createTextureFromAtlas()` (lines 89-98) to use:

**Bilinear Filtering:**
- `magFilter: 'linear'` - Smooth magnification when zooming in
- `minFilter: 'linear'` - Smooth minification when zooming out
- `mipmapFilter: 'linear'` - Smooth transitions between mipmap levels

**Anisotropic Filtering:**
- `maxAnisotropy: 16` - High quality anisotropic filtering for textures viewed at oblique angles, which is critical for isometric rendering where tiles are viewed at 26.565Â° angles

**Address Modes:**
- `addressModeU: 'clamp-to-edge'`
- `addressModeV: 'clamp-to-edge'`
- Prevents texture bleeding at sprite boundaries in the atlas

## Visual Impact
This transformation brought the graphics from a pixelated, blocky look to smooth, SNES-era quality reminiscent of classic isometric games like SimCity 2000. The bilinear filtering interpolates between adjacent pixels, creating smooth color gradients rather than hard edges. The 16x anisotropic filtering specifically helps maintain texture clarity when viewing tiles at the game's isometric angle, preventing the blurriness that would otherwise occur with standard bilinear filtering alone.

The combination creates that nostalgic "high-quality pixel art" aesthetic where sprites look hand-crafted and detailed while still maintaining the smooth, polished appearance of professional console games from the 16-bit era.
