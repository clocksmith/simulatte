# Boot.js Syntax Error Fix

## Issue
The McCarren Park simulator was failing to initialize with a syntax error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' (at boot.js:232:1)`.

## Root Cause
The `loadInitialState()` async function had a misplaced closing brace at line 200 that prematurely ended the function. The actual function implementation continued from lines 202-231, leaving an orphaned closing brace at line 232 that caused the syntax error.

## Solution
Removed the premature closing brace at line 200, allowing the function body to continue properly. The function now correctly:
1. Checks for saved games in localStorage (currently disabled for testing)
2. Fetches the McCarren Park map JSON
3. Dispatches the game initialization
4. Centers the camera on the map
5. Falls back to creating a default map if loading fails

This was a simple but critical fix that prevented the entire game from initializing.
