# QZS - Quantum Zero State

## Overview

**Quantum Zero State** is an interactive 1D quantum mechanics simulator that explores the mathematical concepts of **Zero**, **Reflection**, and **Identity**. It visualizes wave packet dynamics, barrier tunneling, and relativistic effects using a high-performance Canvas 2D rendering engine.

## Key Features

-   **Physics Engine:** Real-time Split-Operator FFT solver supporting both non-relativistic (Schrödinger) and relativistic (Dirac) dynamics.
-   **Interactive Control:** Manipulate wave packet velocity, width, and potential barriers in real-time.
-   **Quantum Phenomena:** Observe wave function collapse, quantum tunneling, and interference patterns.
-   **Unity Principle:** Visual and contextual links to the invariant principle $X^0 = 1$.
-   **Zero Dependencies:** Built with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS, requiring no external libraries.

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2.  Use the control panel to adjust parameters:
    -   **Dynamics Mode:** Switch between Schrödinger and Dirac equations.
    -   **Sliders:** Control launch position, velocity ($v/c$), and packet width ($\sigma$).
    -   **Barriers:** Add potential barriers to observe reflection and tunneling.
3.  Press **[ ☇ ] Evolve Time** to start the simulation.
