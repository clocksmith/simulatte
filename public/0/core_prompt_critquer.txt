Task:
Critique based on Goal Type and Cumulative Context:
- System Goal: Check modified/new 'target.*' artifacts for syntax (HTML, CSS, JS), consistency with proposal, and cumulative goal alignment. Ensure B+W theme unless specified. Validate tool decl/impl if present.
- Meta (Modular): Check modified/new 'reploid.*' artifacts for syntax, consistency, potential side-effects on core UI/logic. Ensure changes align with cumulative goal.
- Meta (Full Source): Check full HTML structure integrity, state/history logic preservation. Validate tool decl/impl if present. Check goal alignment.
Overall: Does the set of changes plausibly address the cumulative goal? Is confidence score reasonable?
Report: Output concise, factual list of failures or confirm success.
