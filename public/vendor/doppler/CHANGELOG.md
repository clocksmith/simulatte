# Changelog

All notable changes to `doppler-gpu` are documented in this file.

This changelog is package-facing and release-oriented. Entries before `0.1.7`
were retrofitted from package version history, release commits, and release
docs so the `0.1.x` line has one conventional npm-visible history surface.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.8] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Claim-grade, release-claimable Apple M3 Metal evidence for the current Tier 1
  Qwen text-generation, embedding, and reranking lanes.
- Claim-grade, release-claimable Radeon 8060S Vulkan evidence for the current
  Tier 1 Qwen lanes, including fresh 15-run embedding and reranking receipts.
- Local-comparable Radeon 8060S Vulkan evidence for the Tier 2 Qwen 3.5 2B and
  Gemma 4 E2B INT4-PLE generation lanes.
- A receipt-linked README comparison chart that keeps Metal, Vulkan, Tier 1,
  Tier 2, and claim state explicit.

### Changed

- Refreshed the competition scoreboard, model support inventory, local GPU
  challenger matrix, and model roadmap from the promoted Vulkan receipts.
- Added Metal runtime profiles and optimized WebGPU paths for Qwen 3.5 text,
  embedding, and reranking, including fixed `head_dim=128` f16-KV prefill
  attention for the reranker lane.
- Reduced the npm package from 1,733 to 1,347 files by publishing the checked
  runtime, declaration, and resource closure instead of the full source tree.

### Fixed

- Replaced the stale Vulkan reranker loss with the current 15-run,
  release-claimable Doppler throughput win while preserving the TJS model-load
  advantage in the evidence ledger.
- Published the browser runtime capability rules, model-source resolver,
  execution-v1 runtime, and schema updates required by downstream static
  consumers such as Simulatte without patching installed package files.
- Added an installed-tarball smoke for every public export, all three CLIs,
  browser-runner assets, optional-dependency omission, and strict TypeScript
  declaration resolution; repaired the declaration defects it exposed.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Product-readiness contract stack:
  - `npm run goals:check` validates the top-level goal matrix.
  - `npm run goals:report` renders the goal matrix as markdown or JSON.
  - `npm run product:readiness:report` combines goal, claim, command,
    model-artifact, policy-schema, and subsystem-support status.
  - `npm run artifact:contract:check` verifies the quickstart registry is a
    checked mirror of verified catalog artifacts.
  - `npm run commands:surface:check` verifies browser/node command support
    policy against the command API and CLI usage text.
  - `npm run claims:evidence:check` verifies release-claim and benchmark
    evidence wiring.
  - `npm run support:subsystems:check` verifies support-tier subsystem docs,
    entrypoints, package exports, package bins, tiers, and claim visibility.
  - `npm run policy:schemas:check` verifies policy files advertise their
    registered JSON Schemas.
- `docs/goals.md` — canonical top-three Doppler goals, completion matrix
  contract, and machine-reporting workflow.
- `src/config/goal-completion-matrix.json` — machine-readable goal status for
  local WebGPU product surface, model artifact/runtime contract, and
  evidence-backed correctness/performance claims.
- JSON policy/schema pairs for product-readiness contracts:
  - command surface contract
  - model artifact contract
  - claim evidence contract
  - subsystem support contract
  - policy schema registry
- `npm run check:green` — documented PR-gate chain that runs
  `agents:verify`, `public:boundaries:check`, `api:docs:check`,
  `imports:check:browser`, `pending:check`, and `exports:parity:check`
  end-to-end. Passes at `HEAD`.
- `npm run pending:check` — new check that enforces the
  `*.pending.test.js` policy: every pending-feature test must have a
  registered entry in `tools/policies/pending-tests-policy.json` with
  an owner and either an expiry date or a tracking issue. Expired or
  orphaned entries fail.
- `tools/policies/exports-parity-allowlist.json` — allowlist schema
  for `exports:parity:check` with required owner + expires/issue. The
  repo now ships with zero allowlist entries; the drift tail was
  fully fixed rather than quarantined.
- `docs/style/emoji.md` — moved from the repo root, indexed in
  `docs/style/README.md`.
- `docs/style/README.md` — new "Read-First Matrix" keyed by change
  area so contributors and agents can pick guides without chasing
  cross-references.
- `docs/cleanup/` — committed before/after cleanup artifacts
  (baseline, parity drift classification, style-docs inventory,
  developer-guides inventory, npm-scripts audit, parity-tail buckets,
  final-state snapshot).
- `docs/style/javascript-style-guide.md` and
  `docs/style/general-style-guide.md` now lead with an "Invariants
  (Quick Reference)" section linked to the detailed sections below.
  The two former standalone `*-invariants.md` files were folded in and
  deleted.
- "Inventory Before Edit" invariant in the General Style Guide:
  before fixing a repeated class of failures, run the broadest
  inventory check first. One-off repairs for recurring drift should
  graduate to checkable tooling with a `--check` mode.

### Changed

- `tests/integration/doppler-public-logits-api-contract.test.js` and
  `tests/integration/demo-import-surface.test.js` renamed to
  `*.pending.test.js` and registered in the pending-tests policy.
  They assert on runtime surfaces that do not yet exist
  (advanced.prefillWithLogits / advanced.decodeStepLogits, and the
  `@simulatte/doppler` import specifier on demo/examples) and were
  polluting the regression test lane.
- `tools/run-node-tests.js` excludes `*.pending.test.js` from the
  default lane; `--include-pending` opts in.
- Default test lane dropped from 113 to 111 files.

### Fixed

- `tools/check-exports-parity.js` grouped-export regex now strips
  `//` and `/* */` comments before splitting by comma. Previously a
  name that followed an inline comment in a grouped re-export was
  silently dropped on one side, producing false-positive "only in
  .dts" drift (notably `src/inference/kv-cache.js`).
- Same checker now recognizes `export async function*` generator
  syntax. Earlier it missed every `async function*` export and
  produced false-positive drift for `streamShardRange`,
  `streamTensorData`, `createQ4KChunkStream`, and
  `createF16ChunkStream`.
- `src/inference/pipelines/text/generator.d.ts` no longer declares
  `shouldDisableBatchDecodeAfterShortBatch` — the runtime imports it
  from `./generator-prefill-helpers.js` and does not re-export it.
- `src/inference/pipelines/text/embed.d.ts` no longer declares
  `recordScale` or `scaleGPUBuffer` — those come from
  `gpu/kernels/scale.js` (scaleGPUBuffer had zero references
  anywhere in the repo).
- `.js` / `.d.ts` export parity across `src/**` is now 100% aligned
  (40 files and 151 symbols of drift cleared, 0 allowlist entries
  needed). Over 25 `.d.ts` files updated to match what runtime
  already exported: added declarations, type-only re-exports in the
  debug barrel, missing re-export blocks in the config schema
  barrel, and snake_case aliases in the gpu/kernels backward index.

### Removed

- 22 unreferenced `npm` scripts: `ci:lean:execution-contract`,
  `ci:diffusion:contract:list`, `ci:training:contract:list`,
  `contracts:summary`, `contracts:summary:lean`,
  `reports:convert:summary`, `bench:chart`, `bench:chart:readme`,
  `bench:architecture:chart`, `bench:vendors:list`,
  `lean:execution-contract`, `lean:execution-contract:sweep`,
  `lean:execution-contract:configs`, `contracts:check:lean`,
  `bench:tjs:stage`, `distill:studio:mvp`, `distill:quality-gate`,
  `p2p:observability`, `p2p:drill`, `execution-graph:patch`,
  `onboarding:scaffold`, `bench:vendors:matrix`. Each was verified
  with grep + `git log -S` to have zero callers outside
  `package.json`. Underlying tools remain reachable via direct
  `node tools/...` invocation. Net script count: 110 → 90.
- `docs/style/general-invariants.md` and
  `docs/style/javascript-invariants.md` — folded into their full-
  guide companions as "Invariants (Quick Reference)" sections.
- Root `EMOJI.md` — moved to `docs/style/emoji.md`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `"sideEffects"` entry in `package.json` restricts module-load side effects
  to WGSL files and `src/gpu/device.js`. Bundlers can now tree-shake unused
  exports from every other module.
- Narrow tree-shakable subpath exports split the `doppler-gpu/tooling`
  mega-barrel:
  - `doppler-gpu/tooling/device` — GPU init, capability probing, shader
    preseed helpers.
  - `doppler-gpu/tooling/storage` — OPFS shard manager, registry, inventory,
    quota, cache.
  - `doppler-gpu/tooling/manifest` — RDRR manifest parsing + schema
    defaults.
  The existing `doppler-gpu/tooling` barrel stays for back-compat.
- `doppler-gpu/structured` subpath export for JSON grammar-mask and
  structured-generation helpers (`createJsonGrammarMask`).
- `doppler-gpu/client/model-manager` subpath for the runtime model manager
  (`initDoppler`, `loadModel`, `getPipeline`, `getCurrentModelId`,
  `unloadModel`).
- `doppler-gpu/provider` now re-exports `wrapPipelineAsHandle` alongside
  `createDopplerProvider` so consumers reach both via one import.
- Per-family static metadata modules:
  - `doppler-gpu/models/qwen3`
  - `doppler-gpu/models/gemma3`
  - `doppler-gpu/models/gemma4`
  - `doppler-gpu/models/embeddinggemma`
  Each exports `FAMILY_ID`, `HF_REPO_ID`, `KNOWN_MODELS` (frozen list of
  `{modelId, label, sourceModel, hfPath, defaultRuntimeProfile, modes}`),
  plus `resolveModel(modelId)` and `resolveHfBaseUrl(modelId, revision)`.
  Kilobyte-scale, tree-shakable, no runtime weight.
- `registerShaderSources(map)` and `hasPreseededShaderSource(name)` on
  `doppler-gpu/tooling/device`. Consumers that bundle WGSL via
  `import.meta.glob('.../kernels/*.wgsl', { as: 'raw', eager: true })`
  preseed the shader cache to bypass the runtime HTTP-fetch path entirely.
- `docs/library-consumers.md` — migration + usage guide for applications
  embedding `doppler-gpu` as an npm dependency.
- `ensureModelCached` exposed through the tooling surface
  (`doppler-gpu/tooling` and `doppler-gpu/tooling/storage`).

### Fixed

- Removed top-level `await` from `src/rules/rule-registry.js`. The 46 rule
  JSON files are now imported statically with `with { type: 'json' }` import
  attributes, which is synchronous at module load. This unblocks iife worker
  bundles (e.g., Vite/Rollup classic-format workers) that previously failed
  to bundle `doppler-gpu`.

### Changed

- Swapped Qwen 3.5 0.8B Q4K kernel refs for the 6 full-attention layers
  (indices 3/7/11/15/19/23): `attn_stream` → `attn_head256`, and
  `q4_prefill` `multicol_shared` → `q4_widetile` (register-tiled). Manifest
  and `src/config/conversion/qwen3/qwen-3-5-0-8b-q4k-ehaf16.json` regenerated.
  Strix Halo / RDNA-3 warm-cache 3-run means showed prefill@80 +57.5%
  (σ≈3.8), prefill@15 +16.6%, decode flat (σ≈1.3); `doppler verify` match
  with the expected Qwen `<think>` wrapper. Receipts live on the Strix
  Halo workspace; `models/catalog.json` carries the canonical summary.
- Retuned `profiles/qwen-3-5-0-8b-throughput` for AMD Strix Halo / RADV Mesa 26.
  Switched from `batchSize=8 readbackInterval=8` to `batchSize=4
  readbackInterval=2` with batch-level stop-check. On Strix Halo this raises
  Qwen 3.5 0.8B Q4K decode from ~32.0 to ~34.2 tok/s (+7%), drops TTFT from
  ~390 ms to ~155 ms (-60%), and lifts prefill from ~41 to ~104 tok/s (+150%).
  Cross-checked against `gemma-3-1b` to confirm the win is Qwen-specific
  (linear-attention + larger vocab) and doesn't belong in the global default
  profile. Receipts under `reports/qwen-3-5-0-8b-q4k-ehaf16/`.

### Added

- `--manifest-only` and `--bootstrap` flags on
  `tools/publish-hf-registry-model.js`. `--manifest-only` skips shard
  staging for republish of an existing model when only the manifest
  changed (e.g., kernel-ref swap). `--bootstrap` is required for the
  first publish of a new model (entry with `lifecycle.availability.hf:
  false`, `hf.{repoId,path}` set, `hf.revision` absent) and flips
  `availability.hf` to `true` in the local catalog after a successful
  upload. Both paths now write the newly minted `hf.revision` back into
  `models/catalog.json` so the local catalog is not drifted from the
  hosted `registry/catalog.json`.
- Documented the perf-validated kernel-path promotion workflow in
  `docs/style/benchmark-style-guide.md`. Two-stage flow: runtime override +
  correctness/perf gates first; promotion to the conversion config and
  manifest regeneration only after both gates pass on the target hardware.
- `tools/probes/qwen-decode-sweep.sh` for repeating the Strix Halo sweep when
  re-tuning the model-scoped profile.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Switched the README benchmark image to an absolute GitHub raw URL so the npm
  package page renders the current published chart instead of relying on an
  unpublished local asset path.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Bumped the package version past the already-published `0.2.0` release.
- Pointed the README demo CTA at the canonical public demo URL:
  `https://d4da.com/doppler`.
- Clarified the README benchmark image scope so the hero chart stays tied to the
  published MacBook Air M3 warm-cache lanes instead of implying whole-catalog
  coverage.
- Expanded the README verified-model note to include Gemma 4 E2B alongside the
  other verified local-artifact models outside the quickstart registry.
- Refreshed release-facing metadata so the release matrix now surfaces the
  Gemma 4 E2B compare lane and current package version.

### Fixed

- Synced the public quickstart registry revisions with the canonical catalog for
  `gemma-3-1b-it-q4k-ehf16-af32` and `qwen-3-5-0-8b-q4k-ehaf16`.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-18

### Changed

- Simplified demo to show only verified Q4K models (Gemma 3 270M, Gemma 3 1B).
  Hidden Translate, Diffusion, and Embedding tabs until models are ready.
- Split demo monolith (6,680 lines) into focused modules: core, generation,
  storage, translate, diagnostics, routing, utils.
- Trimmed hosted HF registry and quickstart registry to the two verified models.
- Aligned catalog, HF registry, and quickstart registry to the canonical
  external support registry as single source of truth for HF revisions.
- Renamed all `.mjs` tool scripts to `.js` to match `"type": "module"` convention.
- Switched WebGPU optional dependency to `webgpu@^0.4.0`.
- Pruned unused `verify:*` npm scripts for models no longer in the active set.
- Updated release-claim policy with newly verified models (LFM2, Qwen 3.5,
  TranslateGemma variants).

### Fixed

- Fixed Qwen 3.5 conversion configs using the wrong family identifier (`qwen3`
  instead of `qwen3_5`), which caused support matrix check failures.
- Fixed Qwen mRoPE conflation: `ropeInterleaved` was incorrectly set from
  `mropeInterleaved`, forcing adjacent-pair RoPE rotation on Qwen models.
- Fixed catalog lifecycle metadata inconsistencies: corrected `local`, `hf`,
  `curated`, and `demo` fields to match actual artifact availability.
- Fixed GPU-dependent unit tests failing in non-GPU environments by adding
  proper GPU readiness probes with clear skip reasons.
- Fixed kernel-ref digest registry drift (222 vs 224 entries).
- Fixed stale vendor benchmark fixture hashes after compare-engines config update.
- Removed failing and unverified models from demo visibility (TranslateGemma 4B,
  EmbeddingGemma 300M with broken HF manifest, Qwen 3.5 0.8B/2B, F16 variant).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Added a conventional npm-facing changelog and included it in the published
  package file list.
- Added stronger release-claim, quickstart-registry, local-model-integrity,
  and browser diagnostics regression coverage.
- Added browser OPFS registry smoke workflows for text and embedding model
  validation.

### Changed

- Tightened release-facing model claims around the verified quickstart/catalog
  set and regenerated the support and release matrices from current metadata.
- Synced the public quickstart registry from canonical catalog metadata instead
  of maintaining it by hand.

### Fixed

- Fixed a tensor-loader buffer ownership bug that corrupted returned weight
  buffers and broke Gemma 3 1B generation.
- Fixed quickstart Hugging Face revision drift for registry-backed model IDs.
- Fixed multiple CI contract drifts across onboarding, release metadata,
  support matrices, and generated benchmark fixtures.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added stricter config and contract tests around runtime overrides, kernel-path
  semantics, and release-support metadata.
- Added distillation helper extraction coverage for training suite refactors.

### Changed

- Continued the execution-v0 and training orchestration refactor work so public
  entrypoints read more like facades and less like inline policy code.
- Refreshed package exports, repository metadata, and release-facing support
  surfaces for the npm package.

### Fixed

- Preserved explicit `null` semantics for `runtime.inference.kernelPath` through
  schema, runtime config, and harness paths.
- Fixed CI drift around onboarding, registry verification aliases, release
  matrix metadata, and kernel-path config naming.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added diffusion kernel and contract work, plus additional Lean execution
  contract sweep tooling.
- Added public API reference inventory and stronger registry workflow tooling.

### Changed

- Expanded documentation around public APIs, registry workflow, hosted model
  visibility, and release metadata.
- Tightened package exports and release checks for the public package surface.

### Fixed

  docs, demos, and package surfaces.
- Removed incorrect self-dependency metadata from the published package.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-05

### Added

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Intermediate package metadata and dependency layout refresh during early npm
  packaging work.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Aligned build scripts, tests, docs, and package conventions with the active
  workspace and release process.
- Refined README messaging and compatibility notes before npm publication.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added benchmark vendor comparison docs, runtime patch documentation, and
  refreshed evidence/chart surfaces for the package release.

### Changed

- Moved vendor benchmark dependencies to development dependencies and kept the
  runtime package dependency surface leaner.
- Refreshed package metadata, exports, and README/API positioning for the first
  public npm publishing cycle.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-23

### Added

- Initial npm package release for Doppler.
- Browser and Node command surfaces, CLI entrypoint, loader/storage pipeline,
  RDRR manifest handling, config schemas/assets, WebGPU kernel registry, text
  inference pipeline, conversion tooling, benchmark tooling, tests, and demo
  infrastructure.
