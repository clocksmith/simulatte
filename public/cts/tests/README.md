# CTS Test Plan (Preview)

- `engine/` specs cover stage transformations, option pool math, SAFE conversions, and exit waterfalls.
- `ui/` smoke tests ensure timeline selection, form bindings, undo/redo, and tab rendering behave consistently.
- Web Test Runner scripts will mount `index.html` in headless browsers for regression sweeps.

Test harness scaffolding will be added once the computation engine reaches feature parity with the design doc.
